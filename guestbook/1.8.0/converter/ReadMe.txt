///  The purpose of this script is to convert the list.txt
///  data from the old format to the format used
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

To Use, do the following:

1- Download and Install the latest version of DigiOz Guestbook.
2- Place your old "list.txt" inside the converter directory.
3- Create a text file called "data.xml" inside the converter directory.
4- CHMOD "data.xml" to 777 (give it read, write and execute permission). 
5- Run converter.php through the web. The code will display a message when it is done. ONLY RUN IT ONCE. DO NOT REFRESH THE BROWSER.
6- Delete the old "list.txt" from the directory and move it into the "data" folder of the guestbook directory. 
   
That's it! Now run the guestbook and enjoy! :)
