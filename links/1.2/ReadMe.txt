What's New in Version 1.2:
--------------------------
- Your Name entered will now have to be 40 or less characters.
- Your Email entered will now have to be 40 or less characters.
- Your Link entered will now have to be 70 or less characters.
- You will have to entere an email address in the proper format 
  for the scrip to add the entry to the guestbook.             
- Any words longer then 25 characters will now be broken up, to 
  avoid the resizing of the table with of the guestbook by odd  
  length word entries.                                         
- The "http://" will now be automatically placed in front of the 
  links, if they don't already have it. Links that have two  
  "http://" will also automatically be corrected.
